# Postmortem

On April 15, 2023, from 12:00 PM to 1:30 PM (EST), our web application experienced a partial outage, which affected approximately 40% of our users. During this time, users were unable to access the checkout process, and some experienced slow page loading times, resulting in cart abandonment and loss of sales. The root cause of the issue was a software bug in the payment gateway integration.

## Timeline:

12:00 PM: The issue was first detected by the monitoring system, which alerted the on-call engineer.
12:05 PM: The engineer investigated the issue and identified that the checkout process was failing, resulting in a 500 server error.
12:10 PM: The engineer noticed that the payment gateway API was not responding, and attempted to restart the service, but it did not resolve the issue.
12:20 PM: The engineer escalated the incident to the development team and began investigating the logs for the payment gateway integration.
12:40 PM: The development team identified a software bug in the payment gateway integration code that caused the API to crash under high traffic.
1:00 PM: The development team deployed a fix to the production environment, and the API responded normally.
1:30 PM: The monitoring system reported that the checkout process was functioning normally, and the incident was resolved.

## Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the issue was a software bug in the payment gateway integration code, which caused the API to crash under high traffic. The development team fixed the bug by updating the code to handle high traffic requests more efficiently. The fix was deployed to the production environment, and the API began responding normally.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, we will implement the following corrective and preventative measures:

Conduct a code review of the payment gateway integration code to identify and fix any other potential software bugs.
Add additional monitoring to the payment gateway API to alert the team of any abnormalities.
Increase the capacity of the payment gateway infrastructure to handle high traffic loads.
Conduct load testing on the payment gateway API to identify potential performance bottlenecks.
Improve communication between teams to ensure faster incident response times.

Despite the seriousness of the situation, there's always room for humor in post-mortems. Here's a lighthearted illustration of the incident:

As the cartoon depicts, it's important to identify the root cause of an issue before attempting to resolve it. In this case, the development team quickly identified the software bug in the payment gateway integration code and deployed a fix to resolve the incident.

To prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, we'll take corrective and preventative measures such as conducting a code review, adding additional monitoring, and conducting load testing to identify potential performance bottlenecks. Additionally, improving communication between teams will ensure faster incident response times and minimize the impact on our users.

We hope that this post-mortem has shed some light on the issue and demonstrated our commitment to ensuring the reliability and availability of our services. We thank our users for their patience and understanding during the outage, and we assure them that we're working tirelessly to prevent similar incidents in the future.
