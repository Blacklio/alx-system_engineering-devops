    Regular system maintenance, including updates and patches to ensure the server is secure and up-to-date.
    Developing a comprehensive incident response plan that outlines clear steps for responding to outages and other critical incidents.

In addition to these measures, the team will also prioritize ongoing training and development to ensure all team members are equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to respond to critical incidents quickly and effectively.
